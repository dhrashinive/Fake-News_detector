## 📰 Fake News Detector

The **Fake News Detector** is a machine learning-based project developed to automatically identify whether a given news article is real or fake. This tool leverages natural language processing (NLP) and classification algorithms to analyze news content and predict its authenticity.

### 🔍 Features:
- Classifies news articles as **real** or **fake** based on their textual content.
- Preprocessing of text data using NLP techniques (tokenization, vectorization).
- Model training using **Naive Bayes** classifier.
- Evaluation using accuracy score and classification report.
- Easy to run with CSV dataset input.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn** (`train_test_split`, `CountVectorizer`, `MultinomialNB`, etc.)
- **Jupyter Notebook / VSCode**

### 📂 Dataset:
The model uses a dataset containing labeled news articles with `text` and `label` columns.

### 🚀 How It Works:
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Vectorize the text using `CountVectorizer`.
4. Train the model using `MultinomialNB`.
5. Evaluate performance using `accuracy_score` and `classification_report`.
